*   **Weapon Ability** For now you can set only zoom ability to weapon, players can activate ability by right-click, you can create weapon ability from create menu (Right click in `Project` select `Create` → `Create Game Data` → `Weapon Ability`)
*   **Crosshair Setting** 
*   **Fire Type** if this is `Single Fire` player have to release button for next fire, if this is `Automatic` player can hold to fire without button release for next fire
