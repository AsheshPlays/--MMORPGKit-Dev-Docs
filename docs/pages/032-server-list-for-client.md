**Create -> Create NetworkSetting -> MmoNetworkSetting**

## Client Production Build

Before you build your game for players, you should add `MMO_BUILD` to `Project Settings -> Scripting Define Symbols`, then players won't be able to use your game to create private server. But for offline/LAN games you must delete it because they have to use codes from both the server and client sides.
