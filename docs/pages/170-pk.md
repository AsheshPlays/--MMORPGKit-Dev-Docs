# PK

This asset project has a PK system which if players whom opened it will be able attacks each other althrough map info's `Pvp Mode` is not `Pvp`.

You can change PK rules by create your own game rule (by create class which extends `BaseGameplayRule`), but default rules (in `DefaultGameplayRule`) are:

- You can open PK, after your character's level is >= value of `minLevelToTurnPkOn`.
- If you open PK, you can turn it off after value of `hoursBeforeTurnPkOff` * hours.
- When PK player killed, the killer's PK point will be increased by `pkPointEachKills`.
- If player whom has a high PK point, player will get penalty when killed, can set penalthy in `pkDatas`.

## PK rules functions

- `void GetPlayerDeadPunishment(DeadPunishmentType type, BasePlayerCharacterEntity player, BaseCharacterEntity attacker, out int decreaseExp, out int decreaseGold, out int decreaseItems, out int attackerPkPoint)`, it will be called when player dead, then may punish player who has a high PK point, if `type` is `PK`. If PK feature is disabled (can disble it in game instance and map info -> `Enable Pk Rules = FALSE`), the `type` (`DeadPunishmentType`) won't be `PK` when player dead.
- `string GetTurnPkOnWarningMessage()`, just a warning message when turn PK on.
- `bool CanTurnPkOn(BasePlayerCharacterEntity player)`, can turn on or not?
- `bool CanTurnPkOff(BasePlayerCharacterEntity player)`, can turn off or not?
